# Chapter 2: Let's look at satellite images
Have you ever seen satellite images? You may have seen it in the weather forecast image or the image displayed by a map application such as Google Map.

Before analyzing and seeing it, let's actually see the satellite image. There is a page called Timelapse on the Google Earth Engine page .

This page displays satellite images taken every year in time lapse. If you fly to this page, you can see the neighborhood of Miami in the United States.

Focusing on the west side, you can see how a forest-like thing has been cut down and a pool-like thing has been built in its place. On this page, there are some places prepared in addition to Miami.
