# Chapter 2: Let's look at satellite images
Have you ever seen satellite images? You may have seen it in the weather forecast image or the image displayed by a map application such as Google Map.

Before analyzing and seeing it, let's actually see the satellite image. There is a page called Timelapse on the Google Earth Engine page .

This page displays satellite images taken every year in time lapse. If you fly to this page, you can see the neighborhood of Miami in the United States.
