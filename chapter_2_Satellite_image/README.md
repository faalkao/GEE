# Chapter 2: Let's look at satellite images
Have you ever seen satellite images? You may have seen it in the weather forecast image or the image displayed by a map application such as Google Map.

Before analyzing and seeing it, let's actually see the satellite image. There is a page called Timelapse on the Google Earth Engine page .

This page displays satellite images taken every year in time lapse. If you fly to this page, you can see the neighborhood of Miami in the United States.

Focusing on the west side, you can see how a forest-like thing has been cut down and a pool-like thing has been built in its place. On this page, there are some places prepared in addition to Miami.

# Explanation of JavaScript
In this book, we will write the code using the programming language called JavaScript. JavaScript is a language that is often used for purposes such as adding movement to web pages. It is also popular as an introductory language for programming because you can visualize the result while executing the code. Only the basic syntax of JavaScript is used in this book, so don't worry if you don't know JavaScript. We will explain it on the spot if necessary, but if you are still worried, you may want to take a look at the JavaScript tutorial of Google Earth Engine .
