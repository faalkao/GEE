#**Introduction to Google Earth Engine -Satellite Image Analysis Starting from Zero**
* Author: Duong
This content was written to familiarize the public with satellite image analysis (satellite remote sensing). [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and JavaScript are used as analysis tools . The target readers are written assuming that they are new to programming, but since some parts of the book require object-oriented knowledge, we would appreciate it if you could refer to other books and online literature as appropriate.

A part of the contents is used in the lecture "Hydrology" at the University of Tsukuba, which is a lecture course on bioresources. We thank all the students for their feedback.

In addition, half of the content is currently being created in good faith (the part that is overwritten and the screenshot). If you have any typographical error correction and feedback, etc., Issues thank you to.

The copyright of the text belongs to the authors, but you can use the code in the text freely.
