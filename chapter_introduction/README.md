# Chapter 1: Introduction
## Preface
What do you think of when you hear the keyword "artificial satellite"? Many may think of Hayabusa, who went to the asteroid Itokawa and returned to Earth in 2010. Actually, some artificial satellites are not only planetary explorers that search the universe like Hayabusa, but also satellites that rotate around the earth to observe the global environment. The latter is about 4,600, and so many satellites are in operation. Now, of course, such artificial satellites are not just around the earth. It is used for various purposes such as monitoring deforestation in the Amazon and observing glacier melting due to climate change. It's such a convenient satellite image, but until now, you couldn't get it without paying tens of thousands of yen to get an image taken by an artificial satellite. However, in recent years, the wave of open data has pushed into the world of satellite observation, and now many images can be used free of charge.

Despite this situation, the use of artificial satellite images has not yet become widespread. The reason was that I had to go to an overseas site to get satellite images, and I needed specialized software to display the images.

Meanwhile, in December 2010 Google released the Google Earth Engine [@gorelick2017google]. This was an epoch-making thing that analysis on a browser was possible without downloading artificial satellite images to a personal computer (free for research, education and non-profit purposes).

In this book, while actually using Google Earth Engine, we will learn about the principle of satellite imagery and its analysis method by moving hands.

## Target audience
The target audience of this document is as follows.
- I want to analyze satellite images in the big data era
- I was assigned to a satellite laboratory at university, but I do not know what to do
- Want to learn programming through satellite image analysis
- I have used Google Earth Engine, but I want to learn the principle of satellite image analysis.

On the other hand, the following readers may not be enough in this book.
- Those who are already familiar with Google Earth Engine
